Good Day Elevator User,

thank you for choosing our elevataor. 

We constructed here two classic 2 way elevators who serve in way we want to
explain here.
 
The standard Elevator

Every Elevator on its own works for the jobs he got assigned from inside. This
jobs are stored in a specific job list. Nevertheless, jobs coming from floors
are served in a special manner. Because of a priority list, it is replicable 
which elevator serves which job. These jobs are saved in a common job list. 
Because of our algorithm the common jobs separated and assigned when it fits
to an elevator and its mode, idle or busy, and its direction.

The improved Elevator

As the standard Elevator, the improved Elevator operators with the same basics
but the algorithm with job assignment and for example a parking position is
fit dynamically. We thought our double elevator might operate in a large 
building with many people to move to certain floors. In a scenario, in which
most people arrive in the morning, go to lunch around noon and go home around 
6 to 7 o'clock, the elevators dynamically focus themselves on the floors from 
which most jobs come, so the median waiting time should be reduced. Good for
participant. Further, in the std. elevator, the elevator closes the door after
a random amount of tics, but in this improved version, we installed a button
that gives the user inside the elevator the ability to close the doors
immediately.

The Functionality 

First in the program you are greeted by a menue. Here you are allowed to
press via keyboard button a menue item. 
1 opens the standard elevator algorithm, explained above
2 opens a improved version of 1
3 opens an overview of the files and the concerning documentations
4 here you arfe right now, in the help file
5 exits the program and leaves you in a void
